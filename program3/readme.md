# Djikstra's Algorithm - Robert Burton
### Find the shortest path between cities on a grid.

## Quick Start:
Extract all included files to a directory.
Navigate a shell, like bash, to this directory.
Run "make run" from the command line.
Premade tests will run and show as Passed.

## About
This program implements Djikstra's shortest path algorithm.
The text files are of format "city x y".
Cities are adjacent if they have the same x or y.
Also, cities are not adjacent if there is a city between them.
Basic modification of the main in program3.cpp could divert to one's own tests.
